## Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13 - Mapping Earthquakes with JS and APIs

Completed by Angela Kumar

## Overview

Use JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)

## Purpose
Utilizing the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

## Resources

Data: Tetonic Plate starter code; Major Earthquake Chart Starter Code; 

All Earthquakes GeoJSON file within 7 days: 
Earthquakes 4.5+ GeoJSON file within 7 days: 
Tetonic Plates GeoJSON Master file:

Applications: VSCode, D3 JavaScript, GeoJSON data files, Mapbox API, Leaflet.js Library

## Background
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Deliverables

* Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

* Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

* Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

Using your knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.

## Summary

This was an interesting project to learn about the United States Geological Services GeoJSON dataset.  What I noticed is that as I prepared the screenshots between end of September to the beginning of October to do the write up of my findings.  One the data was dynamic, as everything changed within 7 days.  Second, there seemed to be more earthquakes around the world that was between 2 and 5 on the richter scale in October.  In September there were some fairly large earthquakes over 5 highlighted in red. 
This was a fun project to do.  I can see how the data could be color coded for geological events around the world.
