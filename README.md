Module 13 - Mapping Earthquakes with JS and APIs

Completed by Angela Kumar

## Overview

Use JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualizations of earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)

## Purpose
Utilizing the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

## Resources

Data: Tetonic Plate starter code; Major Earthquake Chart Starter Code; 

All Earthquakes GeoJSON file within 7 days: 
Earthquakes 4.5+ GeoJSON file within 7 days: 
Tetonic Plates GeoJSON Master file:

Applications: VSCode, D3 Javascript, GeoJSON, Mapbox

## Background
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
